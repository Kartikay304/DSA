/*
    Sum of array before operation = Sum of array after performing any no of operation (because in each operation 1 is added and 1 is subtracted)
    As in finial array all odd numbers are same and all even numbers are same. Therefore,
    Lets say in finial array no of odd and even numbers are n/2*x and n/2*y respectively.
    i.e, sum = n/2(x+y).-- - - -  - - -- - -- - - - -- - - -- - - - -- - (1)
   
    ##METHOD_1
        Let x=2p and y=2q+1 where p amd q are some integer.
	    Therefore,  sum          =   n/2(2p+2q+1)
					sum          =   n*p + n*q + n/2
					sum-n/2      =   n*p + n*q
					(sum-n/2)/n  =   p+q     - - - -- - - -- - - - -- - - - -- - - (2)
	    Here, in equation 2 R.H.S is p+q(integer + integer) is an integer. Therefore, L.H.S should also be an integer.
	    If (sum-n/2)/n is an integer that is (sum-n/2)%n==0 then all the condition will satisfy (as franctions are not integer they are decimal).
	
	##METHOD_2
	    In equation 1  sum= n/2(x+y)
		               sum/(n/2) = x + y
					   i) as x and y both are integers therefore sum/(n/2) must be an integer.i,e. sum%n/2==0.
                       ii)(sum/(n/2))%2==1 (as x is even and y is odd and sum of an odd and an even number is always an odd therefore sum/(n/2) should also be  an odd number)
	    Therefore, if the array satisfy these two points then it will definitly follow all the given conditions.
